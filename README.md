This is a simple command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python. It's my first project after learning Python for just a few hours, and it’s meant to help me get hands-on experience with basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.

Project Plan:
The player selects a weapon (rock, paper, or scissors) by entering a number (1–3)

The computer randomly selects its own weapon

The game plays out over 5 rounds

It tracks and prints the number of rounds played, wins, and losses

This project is a learning exercise, and I plan to improve and expand it as I keep learning!
